# Papyrus Source Scripts

This is a basic repository that stores trimmed source scripts for various mods. The scripts do not contain actual data besides function and variable names, which should prevent any fair use complaints.

Scripts headlined with the help of @IHateMyKite's [Papyrus Headliner](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/102968?tab=files).
